# Cifar-10
This a NN model for image classification based on cifar 10.This model is for classification of images to
their respective classes on Cifar 10 dataset using Keras.The CIFAR-10
dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.The
NN model here is trained on a specific number of epochs to get the best
efficiency and high accuracy.
